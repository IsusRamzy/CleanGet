# CleanGet

## Intro
A command-line tool to scrape the web, right in the terminal!  
CleanGet GETs something from the web, then cleans the output, to be human readable!  
You can choose whether it saves it to a file or view the output from the terminal.  
**Linux & MacOS:** If you want to save something not in your `home` directory, you need `sudo`.  

## Example
ME: `python3 main.py`  
OUT: `URL: `  
ME: `https://google.com`  
OUT: `GOT READABLE DATA
[s]ave to file
[p]rint to the console
[CleanGet]>> `  
ME: `S`  
OUT: `File Path: `  
ME: `google.txt`
